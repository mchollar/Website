        <p>
          Lectios will help you stay on track with your self-guided lesson
          plan.<br />It does calculations to determine what's needed to stay on
          track and gives you a visual depiction of your progress in a graph.<br />No
          more doing math to try to figure out if you're ahead or behind
          schedule.<br />Lectios does it for you!

      <h4>Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For each subject you want to track:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Set up the calendar with start and end dates, and select which
              days you plan to work and which ones will be off. (Holidays,
              non-school days, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have multiple subjects with the same calendar, you can
              build it once and then copy the calendar to the others.
            </li>
            <li>
              As you complete lessons during the semester, update your progress
              and see the results!
