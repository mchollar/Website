            Stuck trying to create an equation while playing a game like Number Knockout using dice and math? Number Builder will show you the solution!</p>
            <p>
            Enter what your dice roll was, the number you're trying to reach, and Number Builder will calculate all possible solutions using basic arithmetic (+, -, x, ÷), as well as powers and roots!</p>
            <p>
            For those unfamiliar with Number Knockout (also known as Board Slam), it's a math game using a 6x6 grid of numbers and three dice. Kids roll the dice and try to create as many numbers on their board using math. They have to use each die once and only once, and use addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, as well as powers and roots (for the advanced students). For each unique solution, they get to cross off that number from their board. Whoever completes their board first wins! 
            Unfortunately, sometimes it can be quite tricky to find a solution for a particular number. This is where Number Builder comes in. It will calculate all possible solutions given the dice roll and the number to find. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Super handy for teachers and parents to help kids who are stuck trying to find a particular solution. Never get stuck again!
            </p>

            Note: This app is only a tool and does not contain the game itself - merely a way of finding solutions. This app is not endorsed by National Number Knockout or Classical Conversations.
